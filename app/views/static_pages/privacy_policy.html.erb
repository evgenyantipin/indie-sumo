<h2>Personal Information We Collect</h2>

<p>
  When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about
  your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as
  you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages that you view, what websites or
  search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this
  automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”
</p>

<p>
  We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique
